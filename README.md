# Hey, I'm Dave 👋

## Frontend Developer → Cloud DevOps Engineer

I'm actively transitioning from web development to Cloud DevOps engineering, learning in public and building real-world projects along the way.

### 🎯 Current Focus

- **Mastering Linux fundamentals** - Command line, scripting, system administration
- **Building my home lab** - VMware + Ubuntu for hands-on practice
- **Documentation** - Sharing my learning journey through structured repositories

### 🛤️ Learning Roadmap (6-9 months)

```
✅ Linux Fundamentals (In Progress)
⬜ Containerization (Docker → Kubernetes)
⬜ Cloud Platforms (AWS - Solutions Architect Associate)
⬜ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
⬜ CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
⬜ Configuration Management (Ansible)
```

### 📚 Learning Repositories

- **[Linux Fundamentals](link-to-repo)** - Practical exercises, scripts, and commands
- _(More repos will be added as I progress through the roadmap)_

### 🧰 Tech Stack (Building)

**Current:**

- Linux (Ubuntu), Bash scripting, Git
- JavaScript, HTML/CSS (Frontend background)
- VMware, Virtual environments

**Next Up:**

- Docker, Kubernetes
- AWS (EC2, S3, VPC, IAM)
- Terraform, CI/CD tools

### 📝 Learning in Public

I'm documenting my entire journey to help others on a similar path:

- 📊 **Daily updates** on [X/Twitter](https://x.com/PhilDave06) - #100DaysOfDevOps
<!-- - 📖 **Monthly blog posts** on [Dev.to](link) - Deep dives and lessons learned -->
- 💻 **GitHub repos** - All my practice code, notes, and projects

### 🎓 Certifications (Planned)

- AWS Solutions Architect Associate (2025)
- CKA - Certified Kubernetes Administrator (2025)

### 💡 Why DevOps?

Coming from frontend development, I've always been fascinated by the deployment and infrastructure side of applications. DevOps lets me combine my development experience with my passion for automation, problem-solving, and building reliable systems.
